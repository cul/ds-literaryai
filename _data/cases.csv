case1,Case No. 1,/case/1/,"Is writing a technical skill that can be learned, practiced and polished? Or, is there an ineffable quality to writing that springs from a unique imagination? Writers, critics, and philosophers have long considered this question, with coteries of different eras swaying the consensus to one side or the other of the genius/technique dichotomy. Romantic writers in the late 18th and early 19th century were particularly interested in standout literary geniuses whom they elevated as divinely inspired. By contrast, a generation later, many writers of the late 19th and early 20th century dismantled notions of literary genius, substituting in the hard-working professional writer, whose craft was the product of training and practice. The early 20th century saw the proliferation of manuals and devices that promised to teach the practice of writing like any other artisanal skill. As William Wallace Cook, author of The Fiction Factory (1912) , wrote, “A writer is neither better nor worse than any other man who happens to be in trade.” These writing aids also arrived at a time when literacy rates improved drastically and the demand for literary products skyrocketed, creating a new working class of writers generating material for mass-market books, theater, and film. This case explores some notable examples on each side of the genius-technique debate.",1
case2,Case No. 2,/case/2/,"As early 20th-century writers produced technical writing manuals and aids for constructing plots that punctured the notions of literary genius, literary scholars were drawn to more analytic and algorithmic means of dissecting the structure and patterns of texts. Part of the larger Structuralist movement, which sought to uncover the common structures underlying culture, language, and society, literary structuralists isolated archetypal narrative elements such as genres, plots, character types, and settings. While such systemic literary analysis was by no means an invention of the 20th century (Aristotle’s Poetics painstakingly breaks down literary forms in the 4th century BC), the examples displayed here demonstrate an increasing focus on extracting the constituent components of literature, which were, simultaneously, also being used in writing manuals and how-to texts that sought to hack the process of writing. The coincidence of academic structuralist analysis and professional writing aids points to a formalist wave in both literary spheres.",2
case3,Case No. 3,/case/3/,"The scholarly structuralist texts and professional writer’s manuals featured in the previous cases share an imperative to distill stories into their basic elements. The early 20th century saw a rise not only in analytic texts, but also in manuals, devices, and methods designed to generate text.  These writers’ aids helped writers arrange plots, produce narrative tension, and create character webs.  Some outlined strategies for generating text through straightforwardly mechanical means, shuffling plot elements to create new permutations. The Plot Genie and Plotto, for example, gave aspiring writers long lists of characters, attributes, settings, conflicts, and resolutions, as well as a device (such as a wheel) that made chance and algorithmic or mechanical selection part of the writing process.

Techniques for combinatorial writing were not new in the early 20th century, but drew on a long tradition of categorizing plot and character types, dating from Aristotle and Theophrastus, and combinatorial devices from the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In 1305, Ramon Llull devised combinatorial devices to answer theological questions and generate proofs.  You can see these devices in the photograph here (of Plimpton 187, a 15th century manuscript in the RBML). Such diagrams allowed Llull to conceive relationships between concepts (e.g. goodness, greatness, eternity) which could generate theological claims (e.g. “Goodness is as great as eternity”).

When mathematician Martin Gardener encountered the plot-generating algorithms in William Wallace Cook’s Plotto (1928), he compared them to those of Llull’s combinatorial wheels. Yet, while medieval and Renaissance combinatorial devices served the theologian, driven by the fundamental mysteries of the universe, the combinatorial writing devices of the 20th century served the professional writer, driven by ambition and financial need to produce narrative content on a deadline.",3
case4,Case No. 4,/case/4/,"There has been a mutually vitalizing relationship between genre fiction and the periodical press stretching back as far as the emergence of mass-market magazines (which, in the United States, can be dated to the mid nineteenth century). The examples showcased here from the American periodical press
exemplify the capacious nature of mass-market writing, usually fulfilling
generic conventions but occasionally offering inventive and well-crafted
departures from strictly generic styles. These are the kind of genre-fiction texts which writer guides and devices, explored in the last three cases, were aimed at helping generate.",4
case5,Case No. 5,/case/5/,"Plot became spatial in some 20th-century attempts to understand and schematize narrative structure.  In writing manuals and journals, diagrammers charted major plot points, connecting branches of subplots, and graphing interactions between people and objects in time. Some diagrams were aids for authors needing to organize complicated plots in, for example, a mystery novel. Such visualizations were particularly helpful for writers of long series, ensuring a mix of continuity of relationships and originality in plot points.",5
case6,Case No. 6,/case/6/,"Narrative analyses, text generators, and plot visualizations could all help writers devise plots, settings, and characters. But writers still needed to flesh out these formulas with detail.  How to enrich and enliven a barebones plot was also the subject of commercial writer’s aids and devices.  Tips and tools for organizing details drawn from real-life that might be used to build a fictional world were also sold. Writers had long honed methods for collecting and organizing narrative material, from simple pocket journals to elaborate note-keeping mechanisms. Many database devices, such as Mark Twain’s late 19th-century self-pasting scrapbooks, were even patented and sold to aspiring writers.  Twain’s scrapbooking drew on the venerable tradition of commonplacing and foreshadowed many 20th-century inventions for storing notecards and, eventually, programs for organizing digital content. Other organizational tools included: notebooks, notecards, card catalogues, filing cabinets, envelopes, binders, labels, bath tubs, and shoe boxes.  Writing magazines and periodicals were crowded with advertisements claiming the writerly benefits of new organizational methods, word-processing software and hardware, and techniques for organizing one’s thoughts and words.",6
case7,Case No. 7,/case/7/,"In the 1950s-1970s, computer scientists began programming their own text generators. Like the writers’ aids of the early 20th century, these programs relied on structural analysis, genre classification, and combinatorial methods. Two conceptually divergent approaches emerged as leading methods of computational text generation: frame-based programs and grammar-based programs. Frame-based programs used generic constraints to structure a top-down approach to text generation. Conversely, grammar-based programs took a bottom-up approach, establishing grammatical rules that could be applied to any context. Some programs, such as Margaret Masterman’s haiku generator, combined these two approaches.  

Like Wycliffe Hill’s Plot Genie, with its dozens of genre-specific templates, or Arthur Blanchard’s Movie-writer, with its combination of pre-defined “groups,” frame-based programs worked within a specific context, or “frame.” These frames drew on the constrained vocabulary of “real-world” literary genres or the norms of common social situations,  such as birthday-parties, baseball, or psychiatric journals. Since these programs were limited to their specific frames, they produce funny or catastrophic mistakes when deployed outside a constrained context.  

Like William Wallace Cook’s formulaic approach to literary production (Plotto), or Propp’s structural analysis of literature (Morphology of a Folktale), grammar-based programs relied on structural rules that could be applied to any context. These programs were related to contemporary linguistic studies which sought the universal rules underlying all languages (such as the work of Noam Chomsky). But, since these programs were not trained with limited vocabulaires and used in specific contexts, they could frequently dissolve into nonsense.  

Margaret Masterman’s work lies at the intersection of frame-based and grammar-based approaches. Masterman dismissed rule-based or probabilistic text generators (such as the grammar-based programs) as likely to produce “idiot translations” and “idiot poetry.”  Instead, she argued, any grammatical model of language should be grounded in real-world contexts. Masterman’s “Haiku-Generator,” for example, used both semantic schemas and domain-specific vocabulary (the typical language of haikus).",7
case8,Case No. 8,/case/8/,"The mechanical plot wheels and first-generation story-generators may feel like AI-ancient history, but these early 20th century text generators and writing devices have robust afterlives in industries ranging from Aviation and Defense to online dating to the systems that organize how you find books at a library.  In this case, we first explore how TALE-SPIN, an early story generator, was repurposed by the Department of Defense to create Aviation Incident Reports. Second, we track the incursion of computers into the dating world, from Turing’s provocation that machines are capable of falling in love to punchcard match-making services at college campuses in the 1960s.  Finally, we consider how the library itself has been influenced by automatization. Research libraries like Columbia’s steward a collection of millions of volumes, making automation a critical part of its acquisition strategy.  Thus our final shelf examines the fact that some of the materials in this very exhibit have been acquired through automatic means.",8
