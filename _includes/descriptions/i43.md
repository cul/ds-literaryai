In the 1990s, the aviation industry continued along avenues opened by Meehan’s TALE-SPIN and the Navy’s ACS. At Boeing, Peter Clark observed that aviation incident reports resembled plots, with characters, events, and causal connections. Clark concluded that if a computer learned to analyze these “stories,” it could answer questions like “Why did the pilots change course?” and “Was it because a passenger fell ill onboard?” Figuring a computer should first be able to generate its own stories in order to eventually analyze them, Clark devised a program like Meehan’s TALE-SPIN that emulated aviation incident reports. Clark used stories from the FAA Incident Data System (FIDES) as a starting point (just as TALE-SPIN used The Little Train) and scripted goal-oriented behavior (e.g. Get the passengers to Dallas), so the story engine would process actors and events until it reached a satisfying conclusion. Here you see examples of the incident reports generated by Clark’s program.
