The fact that this story should be understood as a “Western” is plainly indicated by elements surrounding the text--the vignette above the title, the illustrations within the story, and the identification of the author, Zane Grey (1872-1939), as “Author of Riders of the Purple Sage, etc.”  

Munsey’s Magazine (1891-1929) was an illustrated general-interest magazine, publishing nonfiction, editorials, short stories, and serialized fiction. Its publisher, Frank Andrew Munsey (1854-1925), was responsible for many popular periodicals. Among these were The All Story Magazine and Argosy, both of which were exclusively devoted to fiction. Munsey’s periodicals proved to be a welcoming environment for genre fiction. One example of this would be the development of “the scientific romance” (an early subtype of science fiction), which scholar Sam Moskowitz has traced across various periodicals published by Munsey in the early 20th century.
