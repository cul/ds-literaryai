Only very recently have dating platforms moved beyond the computational methods of Operation Match. Match.com and Ok Cupid used similar protocols to Operation Match protocol, matching parties by analyzing data users voluntarily entered into their profiles. But AI platforms have the potential to be both more sophisticated and invasive— gathering information from across the internet to put together digital profiles gleaned from information beyond what is volunteered, including analysis of facial expressions or physical postures pulled from digital recordings, or other patterns in online behavior. Future online dating apps may simply leave it up to machines to learn what information undergirds successful matches.   

Will, as *Life* pointed out in the late 60s, we just need time to “get comfortable with [AI] computer dating programs” knowing more and more about our online habits? Will ‘online dating’ not unite humans in physical space, but take place in entirely virtual environments?  Or, will AI take a more prosaic role: helping prospective romantics simply with the difficult process of writing.  Match.com recently created a ‘dating chat bot’ that will help users create profiles by using natural language processing techniques to draw people out and create interesting narratives about themselves. In this case, the technical manuals of “how-to” write a good romance or craft a compelling character may find a new audience.
