Price also composed his own playwriting course, titled “Constructive Course,” whose materials the RBML holds. In one of his class exercises, Price explains that a play lives and dies by its “facts” which need to be proven “as in a court of law:” the viewer must be able to clearly and objectively follow the cause and effect of all the “facts” in a play. He then asks students to search through plays and collect all the “facts” they can find--once again, a long ways away from the spontaneity and divinity that Keats and Shelley cherished.
