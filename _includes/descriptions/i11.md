Propp emphasizes that though there are limited narrative functions, the combinatorial possibilities are vast. For example: how a hero receives a magical object. The first column lists possible precursors to the exchange (e.g. a test by the object’s donor, a skirmish with the object’s donor) and the second column lists the actual forms of transmission (e.g. sale, seizure). The chart shows which sub-functions of D (preparatory function of the donor) can lead to corresponding sub-functions of F (forms of transmission of magical agent).  In other words, the chart shows the ways a hero might encounter the owner of a magical object and then acquire it (wrest it away, steal it, earn it…) for himself.
