William Wallace Cook’s Fiction Factory is precisely the kind of book that Pound found so “dirty.”  Published under the pseudonym John Milton Edwards, an irreverent combination of the great British poet and American theologian, Cook imagines writing as the output of a “fiction factory” and details the economic and practical details of his writing career, revealing the pay he received for short stories in given years and including letters from publishers.

After gathering his raw product, he puts it through the mill of his imagination, retorts from the mass the personal equation, refines it with a sufficient amount of commonsense and runs it into bars--of bullion, let us say. If the product is good it passes at face value and becomes a medium of exchange”
