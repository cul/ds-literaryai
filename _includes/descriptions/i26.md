One writer, Henry Phillips, combined his text generator (a book similar to Plotto and Plot Genie) with a storage device. Phillipsâ€™ Universal Plot Catalogue,  a guidebook for plot, included a section on his Automatic Plot Collector, which was a corresponding method of collecting detail to flesh out the plot. The Automatic Plot Collector consisted of 200 custom-made containers, labelled to correspond to the plot taxonomy found in the Universal Plot Catalogue (e.g. Abuse, Accident, Accusation, Achievement, Acquittal, Adolescence, Adoption, Adoration, Adrift, Advantage, Adventure).
