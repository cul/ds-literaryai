The protagonist of the anonymous short story “Mr. Furbush” is “Detective Furbush—a man of genteel proclivities, fond of fancy parties and the haut ton.” Such a character formation will become increasingly familiar to followers of detective fiction, reaching its apex, perhaps, in Dorothy Sayers’s Lord Peter Wimsey.  

“Mr. Furbush” reminds us that the detective story as a genre was growing up alongside of various technologies that would become integral to modern forensic science. Our investigator solves a murder case by doing successive enlargements of a photograph of the murder scene that was, coincidentally, taken while the murder was happening.  

This story, judged as a work of fiction, is not especially noteworthy. One is surprised to find, therefore, that it is immediately followed, in issue 179 of Harper’s, by a new installment of Wilkie Collins’s Armadale (1864-66).  Armadale, a novel of psychological suspense, was among Collins’s major works; and Collins remains an acknowledged master of mystery writing. Such is the highly variegated tapestry of fictions to be found in periodicals such as Harper’s.
