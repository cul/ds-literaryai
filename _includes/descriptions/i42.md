Although even in First Gen AI, many computational text generators were created with real-world applications in mind (see the “Baseball” statistics program or ELIZA, the therapist-machine), some programs had second lives when they were repurposed for use in different industries. Funding for Meehan’s story-generating TALE-SPIN program had been provided by the Department of Defense, and the Navy eventually refitted TALE-SPIN to simulate the command environment of a naval air squadron in its Automated Command Support System (1978). The ACS contained schemas like AIR-CRAFT, PILOT, and FLIGHT, a planner with solution-oriented problem sets like PILOT-DEBRIEF, and a scheduler to allocate limited resources (pilots, maintenance crew).  By practicing with simulated scenarios (e.g Pilot C becomes sick; Pilot B has aircraft malfunction over a no-fly zone), squadron commanders could repeatedly game-out the possible outcomes of complex planning operations. In the article displayed here, you can see the process-model for flying a mission.
