Margaret Masterman, a British computational linguist who founded the Cambridge Language Research Unit, combined frame and grammar-based approaches in her text generator.  Her “Haiku Generator” produced semantic schemas that were populated by domain-specific vocabulary (i.e. the typical language of haikus). Inspired by Wittgenstein and I.A. Richards to see language as a semantic web, Masterman’s work on interlinguas, or semantic systems, also drew on biological schemata for plant classification, using hierarchical trees or lattices.  The first book on display, *Cybernetic Serendipity: The Computer and the Arts*, shows the semantic schema for Masterman’s haiku generator.
