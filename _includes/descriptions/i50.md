By 1980, Yankee Book Peddler (YBP) allowed libraries to order individual monographs as well as to purchase through approval plans. For approval plans, a library would agree with YBP on a set of criteria (in the areas of subject, format, and publisher) that would determine whether any given title would be sent to the library for review and purchase consideration (that is, “on approval”), or whether it would simply be called to the library’s attention by means of a notification.  

After many years of fine-tuning its approval plan, Columbia Libraries shifted, in 2009, to a shelf-ready plan with YBP. In the shelf-ready plan the review and consideration phase is skipped over and books meeting the profile criteria arrive already-catalogued and ready for the shelves. This makes books available to readers more rapidly after their publication and redirects subject-specialist librarians to work other than selecting titles they can reasonably predict have research value.  Subject librarians can instead spend their time remaining up-to-date on faculty and student research and acquiring esoteric titles that would fall outside the purview of automated acquisitions.
