After being fed Lenski's *The Little Train*, Yngve's program then started producing sentences ranging from the simplistic (“Water is big”) to the convoluted (“When a fire-box has four whistles, his bells, Small and Engineer Small, he has heated, little, little, oiled and oiled whistles”). Given that Yngve’s program always derived its grammatical rules from a given text, it raises the question of whether grammar-based programs could produce language beyond that initial starting point.

>> Engineer small is oiled.
Steam is shiny.
He is oiled.
When he is polished, engineer small is black.
When a boiler keeps water, it makes it proud of a black wheel, the steam and his shiny wheels. (Sentences produced by Yngve's "Random Sentence Generator")
