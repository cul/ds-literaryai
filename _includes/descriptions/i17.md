Arthur Blanchard filed his patent for a “Movie-Writer” in 1916, describing his invention as a “means or device to be used as incentives for concise thinking, stimulating the imagination and teaching the basic technique of fiction.”  The drawings show how “grouping or classifying of thought-stimulating representations, such as words, illustrations or bars of music, into a plurality of groups or classes” would allow the “operator” to create novel situations by juxtaposing these different groups.  The groups— words representing character A, words indicating action or what character A does in relation to character B, words representing character B, words describing reactions, and words indicating possible conclusions— were printed on long strips of paper, attached to wooden rollers that could be turned so that “the operator’s imagination [is] so stimulated he readily sees the possibilities of a [new] story.”
