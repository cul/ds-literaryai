While Yngve looked to Chomsky’s grammars as a starting point for his "Random English Sentence Generator," Sheldon Klein based his text generator on the work of  literary structuralists like Vladimir Propp and Claude Levi-Strauss. Klein and his research team at Carnegie Mellon were not interested in linguistic grammar like Yngve, but rather in “story grammar.” To explore this end, they created a folktale generator that produced 125 general myths that could be used to then generate more numerous stories. In the lower left-hand corner of the journal article displayed here, you can read one of the tales that their generator produced.
