Other inventions addressed even more minute linguistic decisions. After personally struggling to find a set of pleasant-sounding baby names, Henrietta Rosa Montague invented the “Name Selector” in 1944. The device consisted of two replaceable scrolls, each with a list of names which could be turned at random so that the user could discover a “euphonizing combination of pleasing and substantial sounding names.” Along with expecting parents, fiction writers could use the device to find character or stage-names. As Montague noted, “authors, movie and other actors often spend much time and labor in trying to select a euphonious nom-de-plume for a pen or stage name, and my device should prove very useful in such cases.”
