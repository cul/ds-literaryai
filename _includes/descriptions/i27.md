While the Automatic Plot Collector was not sold with the Universal Plot Catalogue, it was advertised at the end (and available for six dollars). Phillips also included specific instructions for the Automatic Plot Collector, in case the writer was inclined to make his own. The size of a shoebox, the Automatic Plot Collector could hold two hundred 4” x 9” envelopes.
