In the article on display, published in Library Journal in 1999, authors Anne Heller and Elizabeth Lorenzen evaluate online ordering systems from library vendors, all of which allowed by ‘profile’ ordering and approval-plan purchasing, as well as the selection of individual titles. The authors note that Yankee Book Peddler’s GOBI has “a very powerful Boolean search capabilities and the bibliographic descriptions are very full, yet straightforward and easy to read.” Amazon (purely an online bookstore at the time) and Barnes & Noble, the authors conclude, are not “configured particularly well for medium-sized and larger libraries,” but are good for best-selling and popular titles (they note that Amazon already allowed for user reviews in 1999).
