By the 20th century scrapbooks dwindled in popularity, mainly because the explosion of print material meant that writers needed more elaborate note-taking systems. Devices like the “Chautauqua Literary Files,” a filing system that consisted of ten portfolios, each filled with six re-arrangable receptacles, were advertised in journals and periodicals. Notecards became especially popular for writers because they were affordable, widespread, easy-to-use, portable, and, unlike journals, could be rearranged and classified.
