John Wilkins, a 17th century English clergyman, set out to do the unthinkable with what he called, “The Real Character:” create a universal language that could be understood by people across different cultures and languages. Unlike natural languages, Wilkins’s Real Character would be universally intelligible by organizing itself in a logical hierarchical series of symbols. Any concept could be represented by a basic symbol, which could then be attached to additional symbols in order to create more specific meanings. To reduce ambiguity, Wilkins generated a list of words corresponding to each category and subcategory that his language used. Christopher Coyne's program takes a sentence as input from the user and creates a translation into Wilkins’s language using his own symbols. The program uses WordNet, an English lexical database, in order to find the word in Wilkins’s tables that is most similar to each word provided by the user.
