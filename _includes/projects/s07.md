Inspired by Qurinus Kuhlmann’s "Love Kiss XLI" (1671) and Professor Tenen's discussion of permutation in his class, "Literature in the Age of Artificial Intelligence," Giselle Valdez and Clelia Piperno coded a means for generating haikus based on one's mood.

Using Georges Polti’s Thirty-Six Dramatic Situations (1895), they delineated 36 “emotions” or “moods” that each poem could mirror, depending on the user's selection. The poem generator was created using Spyder, a Python Development Environment. The program encodes the generic structure of a haiku and pulls its data from databases classifying the moods and syllables of words from "Love Kiss XLI."

Valdez and Piperno look forward to sharing this platform with others to expand access to poetic reflection during this turbulent time. Through both the haiku format and the emphasis on emotional expression, they created an online platform which promotes creativity, permutation of language, and encoded poetry.
