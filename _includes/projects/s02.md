Quirinus Kuhlmann’s “Love-Kiss XLI” (1671), and the text-generation method behind it, embody the historical trend of combinatorial art and poetry that is part of a long legacy linking permutations and writing that includes Ramón Llull’s Ars Brevis (1308) and Gottfried Leibniz’s “On the Universal Characteristic” (1679). Kuhlmann sonnets are based on his belief that poetry and numbers are a way to unlock wisdom and discover meaning in the universe, and they employ word-combinations and permutations. This project adapts a rudimentary form of Kuhlmann’s sonnets and employs combination and random choice to write poems in the format of “Love-Kiss XLI.” The prototype code creates poems by randomly choosing words to form word-combinations. The program then fits them into a format of proteus verse, as in “Love-Kiss XLI,” which was defined by Leibniz as “a couplet or a longer poem which is constructed in such a way that the order of words can be changed without destroying its meter or rhyme.”
