For my final project, Thomas Wee wrote a haiku-writing bot. Wee was interested in the way the OULIPO writers, such as Raymond Queneau, used constraints to produce inventive works of poetry. Inspired by Queneau's work: A Hundred Thousand Billion Poems (1961) which utilizes the sonnet form to produce thousands (1014 to be exact) of unique poems, Wee decided to write a program that would compose haiku. This program takes over a hundred poems by the 17th-century Japanese haiku master Bashō and uses a Markov chain algorithm to write its own “original” poems. The result of this project was a chapbook of poetry, entitled moon stillness the melons, comprised of ten of Wee's favorite haiku written by the program, which he nicknamed BASHO.
