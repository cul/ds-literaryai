text: Plot became spatial in some 20th-century attempts to understand and schematize
  narrative structure.  In writing manuals and journals, diagrammers charted major
  plot points, connecting branches of subplots, and graphing interactions between
  people and objects in time. Some diagrams were aids for authors needing to organize
  complicated plots in, for example, a mystery novel. Such visualizations were particularly
  helpful for writers of long series, ensuring a mix of continuity of relationships
  and originality in plot points.
