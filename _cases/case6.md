text: 'Narrative analyses, text generators, and plot visualizations could all help
  writers devise plots, settings, and characters. But writers still needed to flesh
  out these formulas with detail.  How to enrich and enliven a barebones plot was
  also the subject of commercial writer’s aids and devices.  Tips and tools for organizing
  details drawn from real-life that might be used to build a fictional world were
  also sold. Writers had long honed methods for collecting and organizing narrative
  material, from simple pocket journals to elaborate note-keeping mechanisms. Many
  database devices, such as Mark Twain’s late 19th-century self-pasting scrapbooks,
  were even patented and sold to aspiring writers.  Twain’s scrapbooking drew on the
  venerable tradition of commonplacing and foreshadowed many 20th-century inventions
  for storing notecards and, eventually, programs for organizing digital content.
  Other organizational tools included: notebooks, notecards, card catalogues, filing
  cabinets, envelopes, binders, labels, bath tubs, and shoe boxes.  Writing magazines
  and periodicals were crowded with advertisements claiming the writerly benefits
  of new organizational methods, word-processing software and hardware, and techniques
  for organizing one’s thoughts and words.'
