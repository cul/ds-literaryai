text: As early 20th-century writers produced technical writing manuals and aids for
  constructing plots that punctured the notions of literary genius, literary scholars
  were drawn to more analytic and algorithmic means of dissecting the structure and
  patterns of texts. Part of the larger Structuralist movement, which sought to uncover
  the common structures underlying culture, language, and society, literary structuralists
  isolated archetypal narrative elements such as genres, plots, character types, and
  settings. While such systemic literary analysis was by no means an invention of
  the 20th century (Aristotleâ€™s Poetics painstakingly breaks down literary forms in
  the 4th century BC), the examples displayed here demonstrate an increasing focus
  on extracting the constituent components of literature, which were, simultaneously,
  also being used in writing manuals and how-to texts that sought to hack the process
  of writing. The coincidence of academic structuralist analysis and professional
  writing aids points to a formalist wave in both literary spheres.
