text: "In the 1950s-1970s, computer scientists began programming their own text generators.
  Like the writers’ aids of the early 20th century, these programs relied on structural
  analysis, genre classification, and combinatorial methods. Two conceptually divergent
  approaches emerged as leading methods of computational text generation: frame-based
  programs and grammar-based programs. Frame-based programs used generic constraints
  to structure a top-down approach to text generation. Conversely, grammar-based programs
  took a bottom-up approach, establishing grammatical rules that could be applied
  to any context. Some programs, such as Margaret Masterman’s haiku generator, combined
  these two approaches.  \n\nLike Wycliffe Hill’s Plot Genie, with its dozens of genre-specific
  templates, or Arthur Blanchard’s Movie-writer, with its combination of pre-defined
  “groups,” frame-based programs worked within a specific context, or “frame.” These
  frames drew on the constrained vocabulary of “real-world” literary genres or the
  norms of common social situations,  such as birthday-parties, baseball, or psychiatric
  journals. Since these programs were limited to their specific frames, they produce
  funny or catastrophic mistakes when deployed outside a constrained context.  \n\nLike
  William Wallace Cook’s formulaic approach to literary production (Plotto), or Propp’s
  structural analysis of literature (Morphology of a Folktale), grammar-based programs
  relied on structural rules that could be applied to any context. These programs
  were related to contemporary linguistic studies which sought the universal rules
  underlying all languages (such as the work of Noam Chomsky). But, since these programs
  were not trained with limited vocabulaires and used in specific contexts, they could
  frequently dissolve into nonsense.  \n\nMargaret Masterman’s work lies at the intersection
  of frame-based and grammar-based approaches. Masterman dismissed rule-based or probabilistic
  text generators (such as the grammar-based programs) as likely to produce “idiot
  translations” and “idiot poetry.”  Instead, she argued, any grammatical model of
  language should be grounded in real-world contexts. Masterman’s “Haiku-Generator,”
  for example, used both semantic schemas and domain-specific vocabulary (the typical
  language of haikus)."
