text: The mechanical plot wheels and first-generation story-generators may feel like
  AI-ancient history, but these early 20th century text generators and writing devices
  have robust afterlives in industries ranging from Aviation and Defense to online
  dating to the systems that organize how you find books at a library.  In this case,
  we first explore how TALE-SPIN, an early story generator, was repurposed by the
  Department of Defense to create Aviation Incident Reports. Second, we track the
  incursion of computers into the dating world, from Turing’s provocation that machines
  are capable of falling in love to punchcard match-making services at college campuses
  in the 1960s.  Finally, we consider how the library itself has been influenced by
  automatization. Research libraries like Columbia’s steward a collection of millions
  of volumes, making automation a critical part of its acquisition strategy.  Thus
  our final shelf examines the fact that some of the materials in this very exhibit
  have been acquired through automatic means.
