text: Is writing a technical skill that can be learned, practiced and polished? Or,
  is there an ineffable quality to writing that springs from a unique imagination?
  Writers, critics, and philosophers have long considered this question, with coteries
  of different eras swaying the consensus to one side or the other of the genius/technique
  dichotomy. Romantic writers in the late 18th and early 19th century were particularly
  interested in standout literary geniuses whom they elevated as divinely inspired.
  By contrast, a generation later, many writers of the late 19th and early 20th century
  dismantled notions of literary genius, substituting in the hard-working professional
  writer, whose craft was the product of training and practice. The early 20th century
  saw the proliferation of manuals and devices that promised to teach the practice
  of writing like any other artisanal skill. As William Wallace Cook, author of The
  Fiction Factory (1912) , wrote, “A writer is neither better nor worse than any other
  man who happens to be in trade.” These writing aids also arrived at a time when
  literacy rates improved drastically and the demand for literary products skyrocketed,
  creating a new working class of writers generating material for mass-market books,
  theater, and film. This case explores some notable examples on each side of the
  genius-technique debate.
