## Case No. 1

Is writing a technical skill that can be learned, practiced and polished? Or, is there an ineffable quality to writing that springs from a unique imagination? Writers, critics, and philosophers have long considered this question, with coteries of different eras swaying the consensus to one side or the other of the genius/technique dichotomy. Romantic writers in the late 18th and early 19th century were particularly interested in standout literary geniuses whom they elevated as divinely inspired. By contrast, a generation later, many writers of the late 19th and early 20th century dismantled notions of literary genius, substituting in the hard-working professional writer, whose craft was the product of training and practice. The early 20th century saw the proliferation of manuals and devices that promised to teach the practice of writing like any other artisanal skill. As William Wallace Cook, author of The Fiction Factory (1912) , wrote, “A writer is neither better nor worse than any other man who happens to be in trade.” These writing aids also arrived at a time when literacy rates improved drastically and the demand for literary products skyrocketed, creating a new working class of writers generating material for mass-market books, theater, and film. This case explores some notable examples on each side of the genius-technique debate.

## Case No. 2

As early 20th-century writers produced technical writing manuals and aids for constructing plots that punctured the notions of literary genius, literary scholars were drawn to more analytic and algorithmic means of dissecting the structure and patterns of texts. Part of the larger Structuralist movement, which sought to uncover the common structures underlying culture, language, and society, literary structuralists isolated archetypal narrative elements such as genres, plots, character types, and settings. While such systemic literary analysis was by no means an invention of the 20th century (Aristotle’s Poetics painstakingly breaks down literary forms in the 4th century BC), the examples displayed here demonstrate an increasing focus on extracting the constituent components of literature, which were, simultaneously, also being used in writing manuals and how-to texts that sought to hack the process of writing. The coincidence of academic structuralist analysis and professional writing aids points to a formalist wave in both literary spheres.

## Case No. 3

The scholarly structuralist texts and professional writer’s manuals featured in the previous cases share an imperative to distill stories into their basic elements. The early 20th century saw a rise not only in analytic texts, but also in manuals, devices, and methods designed to generate text.  These writers’ aids helped writers arrange plots, produce narrative tension, and create character webs.  Some outlined strategies for generating text through straightforwardly mechanical means, shuffling plot elements to create new permutations. The Plot Genie and Plotto, for example, gave aspiring writers long lists of characters, attributes, settings, conflicts, and resolutions, as well as a device (such as a wheel) that made chance and algorithmic or mechanical selection part of the writing process.

Techniques for combinatorial writing were not new in the early 20th century, but drew on a long tradition of categorizing plot and character types, dating from Aristotle and Theophrastus, and combinatorial devices from the Middle Ages and Renaissance. In 1305, Ramon Llull devised combinatorial devices to answer theological questions and generate proofs.  You can see these devices in the photograph here (of Plimpton 187, a 15th century manuscript in the RBML). Such diagrams allowed Llull to conceive relationships between concepts (e.g. goodness, greatness, eternity) which could generate theological claims (e.g. “Goodness is as great as eternity”).

When mathematician Martin Gardener encountered the plot-generating algorithms in William Wallace Cook’s Plotto (1928), he compared them to those of Llull’s combinatorial wheels. Yet, while medieval and Renaissance combinatorial devices served the theologian, driven by the fundamental mysteries of the universe, the combinatorial writing devices of the 20th century served the professional writer, driven by ambition and financial need to produce narrative content on a deadline.

## Case No. 4

There has been a mutually vitalizing relationship between genre fiction and the periodical press stretching back as far as the emergence of mass-market magazines (which, in the United States, can be dated to the mid nineteenth century). The examples showcased here from the American periodical press
exemplify the capacious nature of mass-market writing, usually fulfilling
generic conventions but occasionally offering inventive and well-crafted
departures from strictly generic styles. These are the kind of genre-fiction texts which writer guides and devices, explored in the last three cases, were aimed at helping generate.
